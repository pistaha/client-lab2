## About Me

My name is Yarik. I am a web development student interested in frontend development, static site generators, and modern deployment workflows.

I enjoy working with:

- Hugo
- GitHub Actions
- UI design
- Game development with Unity

This website was created as part of my client-side web development lab work.
